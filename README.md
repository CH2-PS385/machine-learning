## Description
NutriMate: Calories Prediction and Food Planner

The idea of our application is for giving the recommendations food based on the calories each day of the user and his/her allergies.

## Recomendation System
Collaborative filtering is a technique that can filter out items that a user might like on the basis of reactions by similar users. It works by searching a large group of people and finding a smaller set of users with tastes similar to a particular user.

## Dataset
The food dataset that we used in our project is from [here](https://github.com/NuSa-Nutrition-Scan/Food-Recommendation/tree/main/dataset)

## Google Colab Folder
We are doing the training and compiling the program or machine learning model in this Google Colab [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1vqWzNdNbdt7yoywIbXzPXS6ZmPTaV_6P?usp=sharing)
